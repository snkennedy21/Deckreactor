Today was spent researching and exploring FastAPI. Collaborating as a group deciding what database and how to setup our docker yaml file. 

## October 4th, 2022

Today we had a longer than usual stand up meeting. Consisting of datastructures and how we will build our models. It was a very productive meeting brainstorming our backend details deciding properties for our models

## October 5th, 2022

Took time to understand our code for our api endpoints for cards. Researched more about FASTAPI and our Postgres database. After consideration we may need to choose a different database based on our table data. 

## October 6th, 20022

In standup today we talked over the pros and cons for out database choice and decided that we will impliment a mongo db. after we created our yaml file docker files database volumes. Compose was succesful and began writing routes and queries for our api's. We went with some pair programming in our group today. Devin and I were working on accounts and sean and thomas were working on decks. 
crud was created for accounts and all but updates were completed for decks. We are definately starting to get some traction after our database change. 

## October 10th, 20022

In stand up today we were deciding our api endpoints for searches. Devin and I worked on basic search funcionality and came up with similar code. Devin added in pagination for larger results. 


## October 11th, 20022

In stand up today we talked over todos for our day to tackle. 1 how to impliment our advanced search. which Devin and I came up with that would be accomplished on the front end. building a api endpoint based on user inputs on a form. discussed with our group and they aggreed.  2nd add cards to deck. We worked as a group on this one. creating an endpoint to search for a card based on the multiverse id as an input. then shaping that data. As of now the 3rd of add card to collection might be accomplished by grabbing that card from the database based on the user id that was attatched. this may change. lastly added endpoint to remove all card copies from deck.
